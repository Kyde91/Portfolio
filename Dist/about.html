            <p>
              My name is Kyde, and I am a passionate, hardworking, honest, and adaptable
              person with good communication skills and the ability to relate to people at
              all levels. I have a diverse career background that has provided me with a
              wealth of life experience in a variety of industries and cultures, including
              service as a soldier, engineer, salesman, and recruitment consultant. I've
              always been fascinated by technology and have witnessed how quickly the world
              has progressed as a result. After spending the most of my career in
              recruitment, I believe that the time has come to pursue a career in software
              development, something I have always been interested in.
              <br />
              <br />
              Why?.... I enjoy learning new things, and I believe that consistently pushing
              yourself outside of your comfort zone is essential for success in any
              endeavour. I understand that in order to be a successful Software/Web
              Developer, you must constantly learn and develop your knowledge, but in order
              to put that knowledge into practise, you must have motivation and
              determination to work hard; this has never been more apparent to me since I
              began to learn development skills and technologies. 'Hard work is easy, easy
              work is hard,' a statement that has resonated with me, indicates that with
              hard work and dedication, your job isn't a job, it's what you want to do.
              <br />
              <br />
              Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, staying fit and
              healthy, and enjoying life. My hobbies and personal interests include watching
              boxing (one day I hope to operate my own online Boxing news and forum
              website), competitive gaming, and keeping up with the newest tech news.

                  Below is a plan that I have put together through research to demonstrate how I wish to become a successful Software/Web Developer:
                </p>
                <div class="process">
                  <div>
                    <i class="fas fa-file-alt fa-4x process-icon my-2">
                      <div class="process-step">1</div>
                    </i>
                    <h3>Learn the Basics</h3>
                    <p>
                     I am now learning HTML, CSS (including SASS), and Javascript with the intention of progressing to React. I understand that in order to be a successful developer, I need to have a solid foundation in this technology stack. Practice makes perfect!
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                      <div class="process-step">2</div>
                    </i>
                    <h3>Study and build projects</h3>
                    <p>
                      I am currently self-learning through studying on Udemy. I believe that you cannot become a competent developer by watching/doing classes; instead, I devote whatever time I have to learning my profession by developing personal projects that are industry-relevant. I'm also considering generating projects for clients for practice purposes.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <i class="fas fa-object-ungroup fa-4x process-icon my-2">
                      <div class="process-step">3</div>
                    </i>
                    <h3>Network and Research</h3>
                    <p>
                      A background in recruitment has taught me that networking is a valuable skill to have. I am a member of several online coding forums and have utilised LinkedIn to network, investigate, and question veteran devs about best practises and the best approach to learn development.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <i class="fas fa-thumbs-up fa-4x process-icon my-2">
                      <div class="process-step">4</div>
                    </i>
                    <h3>Keep Learning!</h3>
                    <p>
                      I recognise that the software and web development world is always growing, and that in order to be relevant in the market, I must stay up to date on best practicesÂ and the latest technology. Becoming a software developer is not an instant accomplishment, thus continuing to learn new skills will help me achieve my goals and be better than the day before!

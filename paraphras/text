My name is Kyde, and I am a passionate, hardworking, honest, and adaptable person with good communication skills and the ability to relate to people at all levels. I have a diverse career background that has provided me with a wealth of life experience in a variety of industries and cultures, including service as a soldier, engineer, salesman, and recruitment consultant. I've always been fascinated by technology and have witnessed how quickly the world has progressed as a result. After spending the most of my career in recruitment, I believe that the time has come to pursue a career in software development, something I have always been interested in.

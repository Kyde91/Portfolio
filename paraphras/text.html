  My name is Kyde, and I am a passionate, hardworking, honest, and adaptable
  person with good communication skills and the ability to relate to people at
  all levels. I have a diverse career background that has provided me with a
  wealth of life experience in a variety of industries and cultures, including
  service as a soldier, engineer, salesman, and recruitment consultant. I've
  always been fascinated by technology and have witnessed how quickly the world
  has progressed as a result. After spending the most of my career in
  recruitment, I believe that the time has come to pursue a career in software
  development, something I have always been interested in.

  <br />
  Why?.... I enjoy learning new things, and I believe that consistently pushing
  yourself outside of your comfort zone is essential for success in any
  endeavour. I understand that in order to be a successful Software/Web
  Developer, you must constantly learn and develop your knowledge, but in order
  to put that knowledge into practise, you must have motivation and
  determination to work hard; this has never been more apparent to me since I
  began to learn development skills and technologies. 'Hard work is easy, easy
  work is hard,' a statement that has resonated with me, indicates that with
  hard work and dedication, your job isn't a job, it's what you want to do.

  Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, staying fit and
  healthy, and enjoying life. My hobbies and personal interests include watching
  boxing (one day I hope to operate my own online Boxing news and forum
  website), competitive gaming, and keeping up with the newest tech news.
